The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky

Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind
They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east

The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go
